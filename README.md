# amongus-linux
A utility program to run among us with the android emulator on amd/intel Linux with Windows controls

## Installation
You can download the debian package from [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~isola/+archive/ubuntu/amongus)
or from the [release page](https://github.com/RikyIsola/amongus-linux/releases)

Even if the package is small, the installation is long because it downloads and Android Emulator and the latest
Among Us apk

## Usage
Just launch the program from the menu, and it will start the Android Emulator with a special python program to remap
some keyboard controls into mouse clicks to simulate touch events on the emulator
You can find some controls [here](https://nerdschalk.com/among-us-keyboard-controls/)
